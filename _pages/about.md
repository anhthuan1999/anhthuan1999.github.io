Hi, I'm Thuan, a final-year Master student at <a href='http://ai_conv.pknu.ac.kr/eng/'>Deparment of Artificial Intelligence Convergence</a>, <a href='https://www.pknu.ac.kr/eng'>Pukyong National University</a> under the supervision of Professor Ki-Ryong Kwon with MCSP Lab. Before that, I graduated from <a href='http://en.uel.edu.vn/'>University of Economics and Law, VNU-HCM</a> with a Bachelor's degree in <a href='https://is.uel.edu.vn/?PageId=4f38865c-525f-45ac-847c-538340d12274/'>Ecommerce, Faculty of Information Systems</a> and be advised by Professor Hoanh-Su Le. 

<b>Research</b>: My current research focuses on point cloud processing. In particular, I work on large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation using Transformer architecture under limited point annotations. Besides, weakly-supervised point cloud panoptic segmenation is also explored to process point cloud more explicitly and has a vital role in real-world applications such as autonomous driving.
