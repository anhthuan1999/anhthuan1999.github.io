  abstract     = {In 3D scene understanding, segmentation tasks have a significant contribution in preprocessing and simplifying background, especially in real-world situations. Despite this crucial role in diverse practical applications, it causes high costs in labeling vast points, even in hundreds of millions per sample. To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end transformer network designed for 3D weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Different from prior methods, our network utilizes central-based attention, which processes purely on 3D points to resolve limited point annotations. Through integrating two embedding processes, the attention mechanism incorporates global features, thereby improving the representations of unlabeled points. In other words, our method establishes bidirectional connections between central points and their respective neighborhoods. To enrich geometric features and point position during training, we also implement position encoding. Point Central Transformer consistently reaches outstanding performance across various labeled point levels without requiring additional supervision. Experimental results on publicly available datasets such as S3DIS, ScanNet-V2, and STPLS3D underscore the superiority of our proposed approach compared to other state-of-the-art studies.},

  abstract     = {Although point cloud segmentation has a principal role in 3D understanding, annotating fully large-scale scenes for this task can be costly and time-consuming. To resolve this issue, we propose Point Central Transformer (PointCT), a novel end-to-end trainable transformer network for weaklysupervised point cloud semantic segmentation. Divergent from prior approaches, our method addresses limited point annotation challenges exclusively based on 3D points through central-based attention. By employing two embedding processes, our attention mechanism integrates global features across neighborhoods, thereby effectively enhancing unlabeled point representations. Simultaneously, the interconnections between central points and their distinct neighborhoods are bidirectional cohered. Position encoding is further applied to enforce geometric features and improve overall performance. Notably, PointCT achieves outstanding performance under various labeled point settings without additional supervision. Extensive experiments on public datasets S3DIS, ScanNet-V2, and STPLS3D demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods.},

To accomplish this goal, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable graph attention network that extracts global features in terms of local graphs. Our network presents general local graph, which obtains the most fundamental features based on point order positions in different neighborhoods. Central point attention is introduced to share weights with neighboring points to reinforce central point impacts. As a result, one point in the specific local graph can obtain global features from corresponding ones in other neighborhoods but still focus on its area by encoded central point weight sharing.

By using incredible technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, classrooms nowadays can analyze and evaluate the learning performance continuously. Understanding this opportunity, we build a complete management system for smart classroom applied computer vision. Using the smart classroom solution, students can request for absence and be accepted or rejected online by their teachers. Besides, the dashboard also shows the summary of the present students and absent ones. Next, the managers or teachers can download the attendance list for further reports, the dashboard can filter by week, months, year, and each student. In addition, face recognition technology can use in security that automatically detects abnormal intrusions and notify the guards on time. Finally, the system can track the student's emotions and visualize them on the chart in real-time. Based on this information, managers or teachers can evaluate their teaching performance. Our contributions focus on three following main points. Firstly, our proposed system can summarize data from several devices, analyze and visualize them on an interactive dashboard. In addition to the management system, the dashboard also has a user-friendly interface that can help managers and teachers who are unfamiliar with technologies can simply operate them. Finally, the AI Modules in the classroom are also utilized and improved. Specifically, the emotion detection model has an accuracy of 72.3\% which is greater than the other applications.},
