  abstract     = {Exploiting global factors and embedding them directly into local graphs in point clouds are challenging due to dense points and irregular structure. To accomplish this goal, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable graph attention network that extracts global features in terms of local graphs. Our network presents general local graph, which obtains the most fundamental features based on point order positions in different neighborhoods. Central point attention is introduced to share weights with neighboring points to reinforce central point impacts. As a result, one point in the specific local graph can obtain global features from corresponding ones in other neighborhoods but still focus on its area by encoded central point weight sharing. Experimental results on benchmark point cloud segmentation datasets demonstrate our proposed network’s competitive performance.},

To address this problem, we propose a novel graph attention network that can embed global factors into neighboring points in specific local graphs. In this network, we introduce general local graph, which integrates all points sharing same order positions with encoded central point weights. In other words, it represents the most fundamental features of total local graphs. Besides, local graphs are regenerated to embed global factors by combining general local graph and central point attention. As a result, one point can obtain additional features from corresponding ones with same order positions in different neighborhoods. Experiment on large-scale point cloud segmentation dataset proves our network's competitive performance.},

To tackle this issue, we introduce graph transformer network that integrates global features into neighboring points. This network contains general local graph, which is an amalgation between different neighborhoods in the whole point cloud scene. In other words, it represents the most fundamental features in local graphs. Therefore, one point has two features: global factors from corresponding ones in different neighborhoods and its own geometric features.}

However, labeling these vast points is highly time-consuming. To resolve this issue, we proposed an end-to-end trainable network focusing on limited points. Specifically, local attention is proposed to concentrate on relationships between query points and their neighboring ones to extract valuable features effectively. As a result, our network achieves competitive performance using only 1\% number of labeled points and surpasses other studies, including methods with fully supervised settings.}

By using incredible technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, classrooms nowadays can analyze and evaluate the learning performance continuously. Understanding this opportunity, we build a complete management system for smart classroom applied computer vision. Using the smart classroom solution, students can request for absence and be accepted or rejected online by their teachers. Besides, the dashboard also shows the summary of the present students and absent ones. Next, the managers or teachers can download the attendance list for further reports, the dashboard can filter by week, months, year, and each student. In addition, face recognition technology can use in security that automatically detects abnormal intrusions and notify the guards on time. Finally, the system can track the student's emotions and visualize them on the chart in real-time. Based on this information, managers or teachers can evaluate their teaching performance. Our contributions focus on three following main points. Firstly, our proposed system can summarize data from several devices, analyze and visualize them on an interactive dashboard. In addition to the management system, the dashboard also has a user-friendly interface that can help managers and teachers who are unfamiliar with technologies can simply operate them. Finally, the AI Modules in the classroom are also utilized and improved. Specifically, the emotion detection model has an accuracy of 72.3\% which is greater than the other applications.},
